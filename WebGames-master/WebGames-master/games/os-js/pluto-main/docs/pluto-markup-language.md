## How to use PML

PML is a markup language that is used to create apps in Pluto. It is similar to HTML but with a few differences.
To make a PML file, create a file with the extension `.pml` and use the structure above [PML example app code](#pml-example-app-code).

## Info about PML

PML can only be currently launched through the Start Menu, Desktop and the File Manager. You can currently not launch PML files through the Terminal or DevEnv.
