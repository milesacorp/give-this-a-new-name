  <h3>MeanOS:</h3>
  <b><i>The Evoolution of Operating Systems.</i></b>

  <p>The first decentralized, artificially intelligent, MEAN.js stack, operating system. Mean OS is the only operating system hosted anonymous using a P2P network and a suite of non-standard in-browser delivery mechanisms. Mean OS is specifically designed to support both Brave and Tor but is compatible with all other major browsers. Mean OS is Proud to be a BRAVE and TOR supporter, be free!!</p>
  
  <h3>Decentralization:</h3>
 <b><i>The dispersion or distribution of functions and powers a decentralization of powers.</i></b>
  
 Any use of decentralization is a solution to the issues that are caused by centralized systems. Decentralization in government, which is the topic that has received the most attention, has been seen as a solution to problems such as economic decline, the inability of the government to fund services and their general decline in the performance of overloaded services, the demands of minorities for a greater say in local governance, the general weakening of the legitimacy of the public sector, and global and international pressure on countries with inefficient, undemocratic, and overly centralized systems. </p>
  
  <h3>Blockchain:</h3>
 <b><i>A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network.</i></b>
 
<p>In many different studies of decentralization, the following four aims or purposes are usually described as being important. A blockchain-based hosting service is frequently referred to as decentralized hosting. This is due to the fact that blockchain-based hosting is not maintained by a single corporate or third-party organization. Hosting from peer to peer, as opposed to hosting from client to server, is the primary focus of this particular platform. The software that makes up an operating system is designed to function on a networked collection of computer nodes that are autonomous, communicative, and physically separate from one another. They are responsible for ensuring the completion of activities that are being worked on simultaneously by a very large number of CPUs. </p>
  
  <h3>Distributed:</h3>
 <b><i>A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computers on a network.</i></b>
  
<p>Each component of the global aggregate operating system is kept separately while the full system is preserved on the storage device that is associated with each node. Every one of these subsets is the product of a joint effort on the part of two different service providers. The first type is the ubiquitous minimal kernel, which also goes by the name microkernel and has direct control over a node's hardware. This sort of kernel is often used in embedded systems. This variety will account for the vast majority of the kernels that are produced. A broad collection of system management components come together to form the subnode, which is sometimes referred to as the second half of a node. The coordination of the individual and collective functions of the node is the responsibility of these management components of the system. These components are designed to support user applications while concealing the functionality of the underlying microkernel.</p>
  
  <h3>Hosting:</h3>
  <b><i>Based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) topology, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT).</i></b>
  
<p>It is generally agreed that HostCoin was the first decentralized hosting service to be built on blockchain technology. It intends to do this by using hosting that is based on blockchain technology. The microkernel and a collection of management components collaborate in order to effectively carry out their individual but interconnected roles in the system. They provide a contribution to the overall purpose of the system, which is to integrate a wide range of resources and processing methods into a system that is dependable and effective. This is the end aim that the system was created to achieve, and it is something to which they have contributed.</p>
 
  <h3>Transparency:</h3>
  <b><i>Decentralization, Transparency, Immutability are the three pillars of blockchain technology.</i></b>
  
<p>The term "transparency," which can also be referred to as "single system picture," describes the illusion that is created for users in which the entire system appears to be a single processing unit. This illusion is produced as a result of the ability of the system to persuade humans that the global system is composed of a single processing unit. The incorporation of separate nodes into a larger network creates the impression of a single continuous connection. According to Katherine Brown, the founder and chief marketing officer of Spyic, blockchain-based hosting is a method of data storage that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to change, hack, or defraud the system. Brown referred to blockchain-based hosting as a form of data storage when he made his statement. </p>
  
  <h3>Transactions:</h3>
 <b><i>Transactions and data can be added on to a blockchain, but past data cannot be erased.</i></b>
    
 <p>It is a digital record of transactions that have been duplicated and distributed throughout the whole blockchain network of computers. This record is kept in chronological order. A record of each new transaction that takes place on the blockchain is recorded to the ledgers of each participant as soon as the transaction is completed. Any use of decentralization is a solution to the issues that are caused by centralized systems. Decentralization in government, which is the topic that has received the most attention, has been seen as a solution to problems such as economic decline, the inability of the government to fund services and their general decline in performance of overloaded services, the demands of minorities for a greater say in local governance, the general weakening of the legitimacy of the public sector, and global and international pressure on countries with inefficient, undemocratic, and overly centralized systems. In many different studies of decentralization, the following four aims or purposes are usually described as being important.</p>

A - [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) - After the user has visited one of the participating websites for the first time, this approach continues to make the censorship circumvention library available to them. After the user has signed onto one of the websites, this occurs.

Service workers are accountable for operating as proxy servers for the network, the browser, and any assigned web applications (when available). They are designed to, among other things, make it simpler to construct effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take action depending on whether the network is accessible in response to those requests, and update server-hosted content. They are also designed to facilitate the development of offline experiences that are successful. In addition, they will enable access to the application programming interfaces (APIs) for push alerts and background sync for developers.

After the ServiceWorker has been downloaded and activated, it will begin handling all 'fetch()' events by initiating a standard HTTPS request to the originating website. After the ServiceWorker has been made active, this will occur. After the ServiceWorker has been made accessible to the client, this happens. If it does not function (for whatever reason; it might be a timeout or an error reading '4xx' or '5xx'), the plugins will attempt to get the content using any accessible way. If it fails, the plugins will attempt to get the content using any accessible mechanism.

A service worker is an event-driven worker whose origin and path have been recorded. Service workers are often implemented in distributed systems. It takes the form of a JavaScript file that is capable of controlling the web page or site with which it is associated, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular manner to provide you with complete control over how your application behaves under specific conditions. This allows you to configure how your application reacts to certain circumstances (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).

A service worker does not have access to the Document Object Model since it is run in a worker context (DOM). In addition, a service worker's execution is non-blocking because it operates on a separate thread than the primary JavaScript code that runs your application. APIs like as synchronous XHR and localStorage cannot be used inside a service worker since it is supposed to be completely asynchronous. This is a product of the technological architecture.

Due to the possibility of security vulnerabilities, service workers may only operate via HTTPS. Modified network requests that are widely vulnerable to man in the middle attacks are a terrible idea and must be avoided at all costs. Firefox hides Service Worker APIs whenever the user switches to private browsing mode. Users cannot use these APIs because they are unavailable.

<p>As a result of a partnership with Protocol Labs, Neocities has become the first big website to use IPFS in production. Currently, any IPFS node on the planet can view, archive, and host all Neocities websites. If another IPFS node agrees to serve a site that was previously hosted by Neocities, then that version of the site will remain accessible even if Neocities ceases providing it or closes down. This is because another IPFS node, not Neocities, will host the website. The greater the number of IPFS nodes seeding Neocities sites, the greater the number of accessible Neocities sites (and redundant). And the less the sites rely on us as their major source of survival, the better off they will be.</p>

<p>eQualit established the censorship.no initiative, also known as CENO, with the purpose of enabling users to see websites under the most restricted network conditions. You can evade network filtering limitations by using Internet Explorer, which enables you to access the Internet without limits. Peer-to-peer routing and distributed caching are provided by the underlying architecture, which uses the 'darknet' infrastructure to circumvent network limits and give your browser with Web access. This enables network limitations to be circumvented.</p>
