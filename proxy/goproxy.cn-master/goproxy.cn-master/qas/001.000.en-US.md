question = "I removed a bad release from my repository but it still appears, what should I do?"

If you're using Goproxy.cn as your Go module proxy. Then you need to know
whenever possible, Goproxy.cn aims to cache content in order to avoid breaking
builds for people that depend on your module, so this bad release may still be
available in Goproxy.cn even if it is not available at the origin. The same
situation applies if you delete your entire repository. We suggest creating a
new release and encouraging people to use that one instead.
