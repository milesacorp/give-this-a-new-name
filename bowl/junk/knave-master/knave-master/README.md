This was one of my first long term projects(5-6 months long) and probably the one inwhich I learned the most. Before this I had only ever worked on small scripts or shorter school projects. This project introduced me to the ideas I still use in projects today like how simplicity is key, write clean code for when you come back, rules of least suprise, start small with something that works and take little steps toward your goal. Currently this is based on a very old version of PIXI.js and the gameplay is fairly crude at best.

DEPRECIATED
