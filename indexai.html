Steps to create a ChatGPT clone using HTML and JavaScript
To create your own ChatGPT using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, follow these steps — step — detailed instructions:

Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want and create the named files in this folder.
Create an index.html file. The file name should be index and its extension .html.
Create a style.css file. The file name should be “style” and the extension should be “.css”.
Create a script.js file. The file name should be “script” with the extension “.js”.
Download the images folder and place it in your project directory. This folder contains the user’s avatar and the chatbot’s logo.
First add the following HTML codes to your index.html file: in this code snippet, you will find a “Container of cat” -Div. Later we will use JavaScript to dynamically add the “chat” div which contains all the chat details.
